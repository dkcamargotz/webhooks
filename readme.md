# Exploratory Branch: Webhooks and Microservices Architecture

This branch is dedicated to exploring, prototyping, and validating the use of **webhooks** in a **microservices architecture**. The goal is to understand the implications, best practices, and potential challenges when integrating webhooks for inter-service communication.

## Objectives
- Investigate the feasibility of using webhooks for event-driven communication between microservices.
- Prototype a simple webhook-based architecture to demonstrate the core concepts.
- Evaluate performance, reliability, and scalability considerations.
- Document lessons learned and recommendations for future implementation.

## This is how the repo will work:

## Key Concepts
1. **Webhooks**:
   - A mechanism for one service to send real-time data to another service when a particular event occurs.
   - Typically implemented via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - A system design paradigm where applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate with each other.
   - Promotes scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment.

## Scope
This branch will:
1. Build a prototype with the following components:
   - **Event Emitter**: A microservice that generates events.
   - **Webhook Handler**: A microservice that receives and processes webhook notifications.
   - **Logging and Monitoring**: Capture webhook delivery statistics for analysis.
2. Explore use cases such as:
   - Real-time notifications.
   - Integration with third-party services.
3. Analyze potential challenges:
   - Scalability: Managing high volumes of webhook events.
   - Reliability: Ensuring delivery even during downtime.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Setup**:
   - Create an `Event Emitter` service that triggers webhook events on specific actions.
   - Build a `Webhook Handler` service to listen for incoming webhook requests.
2. **Enhancements**:
   - Add support for retries with a delay queue.
   - Include request signing for secure communication.
3. **Testing**:
   - Simulate high traffic to evaluate performance.
   - Test delivery reliability with network disruptions.
4. **Documentation**:
   - Record the architecture, workflows, and learnings in detail.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python (Flask REST Full Framewoek).
- **Database**: SQLite3 for storing webhook logs.

## Expected Outcomes
- A functioning prototype demonstrating webhook-based communication in a microservices setup.
- Identification of best practices and potential pitfalls.
- Recommendations for production-level implementation of webhooks in microservices.
